# deeplearnjs_dart_facade

Dart wrapper for [deelearnjs](https://pair-code.github.io/deeplearnjs/)

Most code generated by [js_facade_gen](https://github.com/dart-lang/js_facade_gen).

The [deepleanjs](https://github.com/jackd/deeplearnjs-dart-facade/tree/master/lib/deeplearnjs_facade.dart) library will remain unchanged from the generate code except for necessary modifications to make it strong-mode clean. See the [manual changes](https://github.com/jackd/deeplearnjs-dart-facade/blob/master/lib/src/manual_changes.log) for an overview of changes made.

A more darty interface will eventually be written that does away with the need for things like `allowInterop` for function arguments, replaces promises with futures and adheres to the dart style guide.

## Usage
See [examples](https://github.com/jackd/deeplearnjs-dart-facade/tree/master/example) for dart ports of the typescipt examples.

## TODO
1. Port more examples
2. Write dart interface that encapsulates js interop requirements
